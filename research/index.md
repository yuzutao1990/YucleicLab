Functional genomics has transformed our understanding of gene regulation, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic potential. Despite advancements, precise manipulation of functional genomics using clinically accessible tools remains challenging. This research proposes to develop next-generation small molecules (SMs) as DNA and RNA modulators, innovating approaches for sequence-specific genome and transcriptome editing. By integrating advanced chemogenomic tools, our reserach aims to decode nucleic acid-drug interactions and design synthetic therapeutic strategies targeting various diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.
