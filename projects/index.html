    <p>CRISPR-based gene modulation (Cas9 for DNA, Cas13 for RNA) has revolutionized functional genomics, but clinical applications remain limited by delivery challenges. Small molecules (SMs) and oligonucleotides (ODNs) offer alternative strategies for gene activation or repression, yet their precise mechanisms are underexplored. RNA, comprising over 90% of the human genome, presents vast druggable potential through sequence and structure targeting. This project aims to develop novel bifunctional RNA binders and RNA editing approaches for therapeutic applications.</p>

    <p>Targeting DNA at the genomic level holds promise for gene regulation and disease treatment. Pyrrole-Imidazole Polyamides (PIPs) are leading candidates for sequence-selective DNA binding, but achieving high specificity at the whole-genome scale remains challenging. This project integrates chemical biology, computational chemistry, and AI-driven approaches to design new DNA-binding oligomers, optimizing monomer interactions and flexible linker strategies to achieve precise gene targeting.</p>
