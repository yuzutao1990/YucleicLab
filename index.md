# Where Chemical biology and Functional genomics meet

The YUcleic Lab is a chemical biology lab dedicated to translational research targeting cellular nucleic acids. We integrate functional genomics, chemical biology, and molecular pharmacology to advance RNA- and DNA-targeted drug discovery.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our research is centred on RNA: how it is produced, processed, modulated, and translated. By leveraging cutting-edge gene-targeting strategies, structural biology, sequencing technologies, and computational approaches, we aim to unlock RNA and DNA as precise therapeutic targets, addressing diseases linked to genomic dysregulation and undruggable pathways. Our approach is to re-engineer small molecules and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for gene-selective regulation, paving the way for rational drug design.

We are always looking for motivated researchers to join our team and drive RNA- and DNA-targeted therapeutic discovery.
Currently, we have two fully funded, open positions: Scientist (Postdoctoral Fellow) and Research Officer, both available immediately.
